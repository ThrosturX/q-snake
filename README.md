# q-snake (my little q-learning project)

This repository was created to facilitate my personal research on reinforcement learning.

It should provide all the basics to play with Q-learning, but the code is very simple and was never cleaned or refactored.

I would much rather suggest you checkout the `rl-mouse` repository (https://github.com/ThrosturX/rl-mouse), which pretty much subsumes all of the stuff in here.
Note that the `rl-mouse` repository contains a toolkit, TEAL, which has been used in the course T-720-ATAI (Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence) specifically for the purpose of getting students acquainted with reinforcement learning and its weaknesses.
Please contact Kristinn R. Thorisson or Þröstur Thorarensen ("me") if you are interested in the exercise sheets used in the course.
